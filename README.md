# AC Motor Control Loop Design – Example Programs

This repository contains the MATLAB/SIMULINK example programs accompanying the book:  

**AC Motor Control Loop Design – Practical Modeling, Delay Compensation, and Simulation Techniques Using MATLAB/SIMULINK**  
by **Chih-Chun Yeh, Ph.D.**

## 📘 About This Repository
The examples in this repository are designed to help readers reproduce the models, simulations, and control strategies discussed in the book. They illustrate the transition from theoretical derivations to practical MATLAB/SIMULINK implementations.

Each chapter provides code and models that directly correspond to the figures, equations, and simulation results presented in the book.
